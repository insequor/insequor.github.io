There are many things to like about General Stanley McChrystalâ€™s [book][1]. It is full of a first-person account of challenges, experiments and results as well as references to the history of management science. Evaluation of organizations is explained with the necessary theory as well as known examples of applications. It is very practical with a clear message and a tone to encourage action. But at the same time very open-ended inviting for further reading and analysis.

The Team of Teams defines the team-based organization as the starting point: The assumption is the team approach works, but scaling teams in a large organization lose the benefits of small teams.

[comment]: #This paragraph is out of place and goes to a different discussion I believe there is little to contest the benefit of teams even though there are many cases we do not even get the benefits of small teams. Perhaps it is time to make a disclaimer. Team of Teams is written based on personal experiences from the U.S. Army, specifically special forces involved in the Middle East. It does a very good job to show that it is applicable to different industries, different contexts. I read it with my personal experiences in software development. I do not claim that my thoughts can easily be applied to industries since my personal experience is rather limited and did not do the extensive research required to make such a claim.

It acknowledges the limitation of teams in large organization and seeks solution based on two principles: Shared Consciousness and  Local Empowerment. Both need to be accomplished at the same time (one without the other does not work) to reach the desired agility of self-governing organizations.

Shared consciousness refers to the context where the organization lives and acts.
